# Weather App

This project was developed in React. It is a webpage that displays weather information from OpenWeatherApp so for running the project you must get your own API key and paste it in App.js

## React items
I am using different items of React for example:
+ Function components
+ Hooks (useState and useEffect)

## Libraries
+ Materialize
+ OpenWeatherMap
